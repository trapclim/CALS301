CALS301_M3_03c "Transitional Opportunities for the Transportation Sector"

PURPOSE/CONTEXT: Analyzes transportation sector's unique challenges in transitioning to low-carbon future, comparing historical transformations (like London's manure crisis) to current CO2 challenges to demonstrate potential for transformative change.

OUTLINE:

Historical transformation analogy
Current transportation emissions
Transition technologies
Integrated system solutions
Future transformation needs
CONTENT:

Late 19th century London manure crisis parallel to current CO2 challenge
Major emission sources: road vehicles, air travel, shipping
Solutions include EVs, hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen hubs
Challenges remain in aviation and long-haul shipping
Need for integrated transit systems and smart infrastructure
Two-way modular systems potential (EVs providing grid power)
Urban planning and behavior changes required
FIGURES:

Historical comparison timeline
Transportation sector emissions breakdown
EV/hydrogen technology diagrams
Integrated transit system model
Two-way grid interaction visualization
