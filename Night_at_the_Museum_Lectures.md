# Lecture 1 - The Pale Blue Dot
## Why teach climate change
"All right. Thank you, Rob, for that lovely introduction. I am Professor Toby Ault. I am a climate scientist at Cornell University, and this is exciting. This is the first of its kind - a Night at the Museum focused on climate and energy for teachers, students, educators, and I guess learners of all ages. And since we're streaming this and it's going on YouTube, people of the future.

Let's get started with your thoughts on the question here: Why should we teach young students about climate change in our public schools? And I think this can apply to universities as well. Why should we have climate change education? Why are we doing this Climate Change Education Institute for teachers?

We'll make a word cloud from your responses as you submit them. I see emissions, adaptation... sustainability seems to be the dominant one. Responsibility, fear, hope, healthy planet, jobs, renewables, future, farmers.

All right. These are all valid reasons to teach students about climate change, especially here in upstate New York. But I would say there's something even more fundamental that I think is important about teaching climate change, and I liken it to the efforts of people who lived centuries before us who built cathedrals and castles. The reason is because those endeavors - building a cathedral in Western Europe, building a castle - was a multi-generational process, and climate change is a multi-generational challenge.

What we teach young people today, what we teach our students now matters not only because they're going to experience climate change, they're going to have to contend with climate change. They're going to have opportunities, jobs, as something you said in making the transition towards renewables. They're also going to have to educate the next generation, and the next generation is going to have to educate the generation after that on what it means to have a stable climate system.

How do we produce enough energy to meet the world's needs without creating a climate that is uninhabitable for many humans who are alive today or will be alive in the future? That's why I think it's important. It's because it's our time. I'm applying, I think, to the Gandalf principle here: We don't choose the time we live in. We choose what we do with the time that's given to us. We live in a time where climate change is a major obstacle to humanity and to civilization as we know it. It's also a major opportunity. We didn't choose that. But what we choose to do about it - learn about it, research it, become a climate scientist, educate young people - that's what's important to do, and it's not going away.

Climate change is just going to keep persistently making each summer a little bit hotter than the last one. Each new heat wave is gonna break records every couple of summers. Winters are going to be warmer. Fires are going to be more significant. Flooding, hurricanes, sea level rise - everything you've heard about is probably going to continue to unfold at an accelerating pace.

I saw fear on that list of words that you submitted. I do think that there's reason to be afraid. I do think it can be scary and daunting to think about the scale of climate change that's happening now, and the scale of changes that we need to make to our entire global civilization to combat it. I think fear is a valid response to that. But I also think that we have erred over the last 20 or 30 years in our public communication and our climate change education in dwelling too much on fear and not enough on hope and joy, and the opportunities for really improving the quality of life for billions of people by moving towards a different global system of producing energy that doesn't have the byproduct of increasing carbon dioxide levels.

I would also say that acting out of fear - this is a philosophical point, I admit, and a bit of a tangent - but acting out of fear opens the gateway to us making choices and rushing into solutions that are not well thought through, and are not necessarily moral or ethical actions. And so, as much as I can relate to and empathize with that feeling of fear about climate change, I invite all of you to find a reason to teach and to think and to work on climate change that's different from fear. I also think it's longer lasting if you find some other drive or some other motivator to tackle the problem of climate change besides fear.

## Understanding Energy

Now, you can do this on your note cards, so just hold them up, and I'll look around the room at what people say: What is energy? What is it we're talking about when we talk about energy? It's the picture I took a few years ago from the Columbia River. It's the Dalles dam in Oregon, right between Oregon and Washington. You can see Mount Hood in the background there.

What is energy? What are we talking about when we talk about energy? Yes, it can be used to do work, cannot be created or destroyed. It's everywhere and everything. Yeah, I like that one. Are you Stephanie? Yeah. I had a student who once told me, "Energy is everything. Energy is life, man." And I agree. That's a good way of putting it.

Energy - and we are energy. Literally, we are energy. If you were to walk into a nuclear furnace - I don't advise that you do that - but if you were to walk into a nuclear furnace and convert the mass in your body into energy, you could do it. It would be plausible, given what we know about physics based on Einstein's formula, E equals MC squared. Energy is produced when you convert mass times the speed of light squared.

## Common Forms of Energy

Common forms of energy that you're probably familiar with - kinetic, that's movement. So as I move around this room, that's kinetic energy. Radiant energy - that's what the sun is emitting. Sunlight is a form of radiant energy, electromagnetic radiation more broadly. So radio waves, infrared radiation, those are all types of radiant energy. X-rays - yes, Kevin? X-rays, yes.

Then there's this idea of potential energy. So imagine that I take an apple - do a little thought experiment. We're gonna do a lot of thought experiments today, so get your thought experiments ready. Take an apple, lift it off the floor - I don't know why it was on the floor in the first place - lift the apple off the floor. And now the force of gravity is acting on that apple, and if I release it, it's going to convert the potential energy from having been lifted off the floor into kinetic energy as it falls into movement.

Chemical energy - that's bonds between molecules, between atoms. And if I eat the apple, probably after washing it off, and start digesting it, then I'm taking the sugar, the glucose in the apple, and I'm converting it into glycogen in my body. Then I can use that glycogen to move around. I can convert the chemical energy into kinetic energy, or I can use it to stay warm. Thermal energy - that's what we're talking about when we're thinking about the vibration of molecules or atoms in ordinary matter. So then gas or solids, liquids, plasma - that's thermal energy.

## A Cosmic Thought Experiment

Another thought experiment here. Now I want you to close your eyes. Imagine you're not from Earth. You're not even from this solar system. You are traveling from a different star system hundreds of thousands of light years away. And you're looking for life in the galaxy. And you're passing by our solar system, and you notice that the third planet from this star - our sun, third planet from our Sun - has a little bit of a pale, bluish glow to it.

And with the instruments on board your spacecraft, you're able to determine that glow, that reflection of sunlight - a little bit bluish - is from liquid water. And not only that, you're able to detect the amount of sunlight that's being reflected from the planet. You're able to see how much sunlight is reaching the planet, and you start to do some calculations. And you realize that given how much sunlight is reaching that third planet from the star, given how much it's reflecting, the surface should be completely frozen over. It doesn't have enough energy. Its energy balance is not sufficient to support liquid water.

And yet there it is. So maybe you turn to one of your colleagues, and you explain your observations, and they say, "Well, it has greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."

So why is that? Why must it have greenhouse gases in the atmosphere? Well, the role of greenhouse gases is to trap heat. So by having greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, what's happening is that sunlight's reaching the surface of the planet, heating it up. And when it's heated up, the energy leaves the planet in the form of long wave radiation - infrared radiation - and greenhouse gases absorb that infrared radiation, slow it down, and that warms the atmosphere and keeps those oceans mostly liquid.

You have a clue that there must be greenhouse gases on that planet. Without greenhouse gases on that planet, there wouldn't be liquid oceans.

## Understanding Planetary Climate

Now let's shift gears a tiny bit. Talk about planetary climate. What is planetary climate? What comes to mind when you think about planetary climate?

Yeah, based on what you said, planetary climate is determined by the balance of energy coming into the whole climate system and leaving it. That's planetary climate.

## Local Climate vs. Planetary Climate

So now, what is local climate? What are we talking about when we think about local climate?

"Climate is what you expect, weather's what you get." Yes, that's a classic. It's a classic one. Did Sam? Yeah, it's a classic - climate is what you expect, weather is what you get.

I think of climate and weather like this. I want you to again do a thought experiment. Imagine that you have elderly parents or grandparents at Kendal, which is the retirement community in Ithaca, just about 2 miles north of Cornell's campus. You've got some grandparents living at Kendal, and they brought their dog with them into retirement. Dog has clung on to life for longer than expected - it's a 12-year-old dog. It's doing great, it's a very healthy, happy dog. Your grandparents are having a hard time giving the dog the exercise that it needs. So you go over 4 or 5 times a week, maybe during your lunch break in the afternoon, to help your grandparents.

And you take the dog for a walk. Now, Kendal Apartments or Kendal retirement community in Ithaca has this nice, almost circular path around the entire property. It's about a mile and a half, let's say. So you walk that mile and a half path at a pretty steady pace, following the sidewalks, the whole perimeter of Kendal.

Well, the dog, of course, doesn't follow that same steady path. The dog is zigzagging and wiggling all over the place, going back and forth, going side to side, sniffing a bush over there, tries to chase a squirrel.

So you can think about this relationship between your path, which is smooth and pretty much the same every day that you go over there - you take the same route every time - you can think of that as like climate, whereas the path of the dog, that's more like weather. Weather is what happens. This is what Sam said - "Weather's what you get, climate's what you expect." So climate is an expectation for a given location during a given season.

We base our ideas about climate off of average weather conditions, but it's really an expectation of what's normal, what we should see during a given part of the year at a given location. So, of course, the climate of Tucson, Arizona is very different than the climate of Ithaca, New York. So what you would expect on January 1st in Tucson is not the same as what you'd expect in Ithaca, or on Ontario, or in Costa Rica. You name it - what you expect at any given part of the year, any given site, that's climate. That's local climate, which is different from planetary climate which is really just the energy balance of incoming solar radiation and outgoing long wave radiation.

## The Connection Between Climate and Energy

Now, we've already introduced some of the ideas that we need to answer this question, but let's think about what are the connections between climate and energy. Obviously, the way that we're making energy today is causing climate change. We're producing energy for electricity using coal, using gas, using fossil fuels, creating not just electricity but heat, gasoline for transportation, many of our agricultural practices - it all contributes to greenhouse gases. That's one connection. What are some other connections? Let's hear what you have to say.

Oh, yes, Kelly. Good one. So Kelly said that energy feeds the climate system. Energy feeds the climate system. I think that's a really nice way of putting it, actually. Energy comes into the climate system, and that's what's available to do work. And that work could be the circulation of the oceans, circulation of the atmosphere, convection, all of it. Yeah, the winds, all of it. I like that. It's a good way of putting it. You did your reading - good job.

## Understanding Radiant Energy

A few slides back, we talked about common forms of energy. Let's spend a little bit of time on radiant energy. I want to expand on that because it's very relevant to the connections between climate and energy. But before we do, you need a couple of important facts about electromagnetic radiation, sometimes abbreviated as EMR.

First fact: All ordinary matter continuously and spontaneously emits electromagnetic radiation. All ordinary matter continuously and spontaneously emits electromagnetic radiation. I had to put "ordinary" in there because I had a student once complain that dark matter doesn't do that. Okay, fair enough.

Second fact: The kind, the flavor, the type of electromagnetic radiation emitted depends on the temperature of the object emitting it, all other things being equal. There are different ways to produce different types of electromagnetic radiation, but in an ideal case, with no special surface properties of the object, the kind of electromagnetic radiation emitted depends on the temperature of the object emitting it.

And you're familiar with this concept. You're more familiar with this idea than you might think. For example, if I were to take a fork - and I actually did this for my son's third grade class - I were to take a fork and hold a blowtorch to it, eventually that fork would get hot enough to glow red. And that's because it's changing the kind of electromagnetic radiation that it's emitting from long wave infrared radiation which our eyes can't see to visible light when it's heated up several hundred degrees, and our eyes can see it. That's why it appears to glow red.

## The Electromagnetic Spectrum

Let's look at the whole spectrum. Let's think about the whole spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. So if you imagine the longest wavelengths that are emitted by the coolest objects in the universe, the coldest objects in the universe - so dead stars, for example - those are going to be radio waves, and they have length scales as large as buildings. As we move through the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, we have microwaves, which are on the scale of a few centimeters. Infrared radiation, which is on the scale of the point of a needle. Visible wavelengths - they're about as long as the smallest living organisms, protozoans. Then we move into ultraviolet radiation, which is on the scale of molecules. That's one of the reasons why you should wear sunblock - ultraviolet radiation can damage your skin because it's damaging the molecules, bumping them out of place in your cells. Then we move further - X-rays are as small as atoms, and gamma rays that are as small as atomic nuclei.

## Planetary Observations

Looking back at our spaceship example - if you imagine this like a sandwich, this planet would look sort of like a spherical sandwich. On either side of it, on the top and the bottom, you have let's call it like a green, dark bluish-green layer. That's the bread, and that's where there's not very much - there's not as much long wave radiation escaping the planet. And then you've got three layers in the middle: you have one layer of deserts, the desert zones north and south of the equator, and then you've got right at the equator, the tropical zone with the convection.

## Final Thoughts: The Pale Blue Dot

Finally, should you get a chance, you can google it - "Pale Blue Dot" image and writing by Carl Sagan. He was able to convince the engineers of the Voyager spacecraft as it left the solar system to turn the camera back and point it at Earth and take one last picture. And what you see is there's this almost just a few, just a handful of pixels that are glowing more brightly than the rest of the backdrop. And that's Earth. And Carl Sagan reflects on this in a very poetic and beautiful way in the pale blue dot passages that you can find anywhere.

He makes the point that this is the only home we've ever known. This is the place, this little pixel, this little pale blue dot is the only place where anyone who's ever lived has lived. There's no person who has been able to survive anywhere outside the protective shield of our atmosphere and our climate. And that underscores the importance - going back to why we should teach about climate change - that underscores the importance of protecting this pale blue dot, or, as Carl Sagan puts it, a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

Thank you.

# Lecture 2 - Goldilocks (Zone) and the Three Planets

"All right. Welcome back to the second lecture in our Climate and Energy Night at the Museum, brought to you by PRI. I am Professor Toby Ault from Cornell University.

Today we're going to be talking about the Goldilocks Zone - Earth being in the Goldilocks Zone. Last time we talked about the fact that there's liquid water on Earth, which means that there must be some kind of greenhouse effect. Well, as it turns out, that problem goes back a lot farther. It's a problem with a pedigree.

## Defining the Goldilocks Zone

First, let's define the Goldilocks Zone. It's an intuitive concept. The idea is that if you're too close to a star, in this case the sun, it's too hot. So Mercury and Venus are not habitable, or at least not habitable by life as we know it, because they're too close to the star. Mars might have been habitable at some point if it had more of a greenhouse effect - we'll look at why that is later - but it's too cold now. Earth is just right.

That's an intuitive concept, except that things get complicated when you look at the history of our planet and the history of the sun, because what we know from astrophysics is that the sun has been getting brighter and hotter for the last 4.5 billion years. But if today's greenhouse effect were just as weak 4 billion years ago, then Earth's temperatures would have been too cold to support liquid oceans 3-4 billion years ago. And yet there's abundant evidence that there were liquid oceans. Earth's actual temperatures were much warmer than you'd predict from only knowing about today's greenhouse effect and knowing that the sun has been brightening, intensifying through time.

This is often called the habitability problem or the faint young sun paradox. Before we can really dive into it, we're going to have to define some quantities here.

## Understanding Energy Units

We're going to have to start with our units of energy, which are called joules. We'll abbreviate that as J. What's a joule? Well, a joule is easy - it's just a Newton-meter. One Newton times one meter.

A Newton, intuitively, is a measure of force, and we measure force, as you probably know, as mass times acceleration. Force equals mass times acceleration. So our units of a Newton are going to be kilograms per meter per second squared, or kilograms per meter per second per second.

What does a Newton of force feel like? No, it's not a pound - that's a weight, and it's a different unit, also a different concept. A Newton of force is easy to remember because if you took a small apple, balanced it in your hand, extended your arm, the force of gravity acting on that apple is equal to one Newton, approximately. So the force that your hand has to exert against that apple is approximately one Newton. That's about one Newton - it's the force that on planet Earth your hand would have to exert against the mass, the apple, to keep it from falling to the surface.
